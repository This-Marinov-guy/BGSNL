It involved sampling and evaluating different types of wines - 3 red wines and 2 white wines. We put our guests in groups of 2 and they had a list of wines and descriptions which they had to put together after tasting each of the wines. The group with the most right answers won a prize which was a special wine bought from Paris.`,
