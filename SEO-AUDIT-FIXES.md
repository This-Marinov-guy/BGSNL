# SEO Audit Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified & Fixed

Based on the SEO audit, the following issues were identified and resolved:

---

## ✅ 1. robots.txt Validation Errors (48 errors) - FIXED

### Issue
The wildcard pattern `*/purchase-ticket/` in robots.txt is not valid according to the robots.txt standard specification.

### Solution
Replaced the wildcard pattern with explicit paths for each region:

**Before**:
```
Disallow: */purchase-ticket/
```

**After**:
```
Disallow: /amsterdam/purchase-ticket/
Disallow: /breda/purchase-ticket/
Disallow: /eindhoven/purchase-ticket/
Disallow: /groningen/purchase-ticket/
Disallow: /leiden_hague/purchase-ticket/
Disallow: /leeuwarden/purchase-ticket/
Disallow: /maastricht/purchase-ticket/
Disallow: /rotterdam/purchase-ticket/
```

**Result**: robots.txt now validates correctly ✅

## ✅ 2. Links Without Descriptive Text (10 links) - FIXED

### Issue
Social media links containing only icons (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn icons) without descriptive text or aria-labels. This affects:
- Screen reader accessibility
- SEO crawlers understanding link purpose

### Locations Fixed
1. **Contact Page** (`src/pages/information/Contact.jsx`)
2. **Footer Component** (`src/component/footer/Footer.jsx`)
3. **FooterTwo Component** (`src/component/footer/FooterTwo.jsx`)

### Solution
Created a new SEO helper utility (`src/util/functions/seo-helpers.js`) with functions:
- `getSocialPlatformName(url)` - Detects social platform from URL
- `getSocialAriaLabel(url, region)` - Generates descriptive aria-labels

**Example Fix**:

**Before**:
```jsx
<a href={val.link}>{val.Social}</a>
```

**After**:
```jsx
<a 
  href={val.link}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  aria-label={getSocialAriaLabel(val.link, region)}
>
  {val.Social}
</a>
```

**Generated aria-labels**:
- "Visit Bulgarian Society Netherlands on Instagram"
- "Visit Bulgarian Society Groningen on Facebook"
- "Visit Bulgarian Society Rotterdam on LinkedIn"
- etc.

**Result**: All social media links now have descriptive aria-labels ✅

---

## ✅ 3. Links Not Crawlable - FIXED

### Issue
Several external links were missing proper attributes:
- Missing `target="_blank"` on external links
- Missing `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (security vulnerability)
- Clickable elements without proper `role` attributes

### Files Fixed
1. **Strap.jsx** (`src/elements/banners/Strap.jsx`)
   - Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links
   - Added `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` to clickable anchor elements
   - Added `onKeyPress` handler for keyboard accessibility
   - Added `aria-label` for screen readers

2. **Footer.jsx** and **FooterTwo.jsx**
   - Added `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to "Terms and policy" links
   - Added to all social media links

3. **EventDetails.jsx** (already fixed earlier)
   - Fixed external ticket link with proper `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

**Result**: All external links now have proper security and accessibility attributes ✅
